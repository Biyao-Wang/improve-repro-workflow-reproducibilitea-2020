# Improve your workflow for reproducible science

For data analysis to be reproducible, the data and code should be assembled in a way such that results (e.g. tables and figures) can be re-created. While the scientific community is by and large in agreement that reproducibility is a minimal standard by which data analyses should be evaluated, and a myriad of software tools for reproducible computing exist, it is still not trivial to reproduce someone's (sometimes your own!) results without fiddling with unavailable analysis data, external dependencies, missing packages, out of date software, etc. In this workshop we will demonstrate a workflow for reproducible data science with R, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub. Experience with R is expected but familiarity with the other tools is not required. The workshop will consist of demonstrations and hands-on exercises.

## Time

(45 min content + 15 min Q&A) x 2

## Audience

Mostly academic

## Original vision

- Hour 1: R Markdown
- Hour 2: Git

Use RStudio Cloud, a few hands on exercises.

## Others

* Multiple cursors
* Portability of content between Rmd formats
* gt
* https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/read-chunk.html
* bookdown::html_document2 for figure numbers
* patchwork
* read_excel & read_sheet -- form data collection
* form options: https://forms.gle/EoUJQALNFeZkRgex8
	- rticles
	- making slides
	- making tables


## New shiny things to highlight

- Visual editor
- Citations

Q: How to do this without boring people given hands-on using Cloud is not possible?

## Things that might not make it into a 2-hr workshop 

... but that I've covered in 2-day workshops (Data Carpentry also covers)

- Naming
- Organisation / here
- Automation (via Make)

## Other things I've never taght

... but I know others do

- Binder
- drake - larger scale computational needs
	- sth new replacement for it?

## Other things I've taught, but not in reproducibility workshops

- Publishing to RPubs, Connect
